Use the Side-by-Side Full-Stacked Bar series to compare percentage contributions of values to totals in each category. Side-by-side display enhances chart readability and allows users to compare stacks displayed next to each other.

Note that you need to use the [Stack](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStackedBarSeriesBase-3.Stack) property to enable side-by-side views.
