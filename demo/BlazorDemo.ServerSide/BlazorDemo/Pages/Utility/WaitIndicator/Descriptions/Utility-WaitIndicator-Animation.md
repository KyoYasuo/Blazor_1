The Wait Indicator plays an animation to indicate the progress. Use the [AnimationType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxWaitIndicator.AnimationType) property to choose between three animation types: Spin, Pulse, or Flip. This demo also shows how to specify a [template](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxWaitIndicator.Template) with custom content (an icon) for an indicator with the Flip animation.
