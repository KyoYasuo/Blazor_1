The DevExpress UI components support Blazor's form validation. You can read about the Blazor forms and validation in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-validation?view=aspnetcore-3.0).

In the demo examples we will use the Starship class that defines validation logic based on [data annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation?view=aspnetcore-3.0). This class has been taken from the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-validation?view=aspnetcore-3.0) with only slight modifications.

**Note**: You should not rely on form validation alone to secure your Blazor-powered app. Form validation is designed to improve usability. A threat actor can bypass validation and send malicious data to the server. To minimize security related threats/risks, you must validate user input using multiple strategies. Refer to the following topic for more information: [Validate User Input](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404263/common-concepts/validate-user-input).
