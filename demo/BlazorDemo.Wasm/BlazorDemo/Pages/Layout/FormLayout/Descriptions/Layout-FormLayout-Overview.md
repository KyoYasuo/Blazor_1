The DevExpress [Form Layout](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayout) component for Blazor allows you to construct responsive and automatically-aligned edit forms.

The component uses a responsive grid system based on the [CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) to render items. Each layout item can occupy between 1 and 12 columns. This value can be defined separately for six different screen resolution types as listed below:

1.  [ColSpanXxl](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanXxl) — Screens that are 1400px or wider.
1.  [ColSpanXl](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanXl) — Screens that are 1200px or wider.
2.  [ColSpanLg](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanLg) — Screens that are 992px or wider.
3.  [ColSpanMd](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanMd) — Screens that are 768px or wider.
4.  [ColSpanSm](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanSm) — Screens that are 576px or wider.
5.  [ColSpanXs](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.FormLayoutItemBase.ColSpanXs) — Screens that are less than 576px.

Form Layout items support different size modes. To specify the component's size in code, use the [SizeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFormLayout.SizeMode) property. To apply different size modes in the demo, use the drop-down list in the demo card's header.
