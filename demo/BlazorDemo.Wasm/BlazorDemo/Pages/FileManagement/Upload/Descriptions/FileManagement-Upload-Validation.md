The [Upload](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload) component allows you to validate uploaded files on the client. This demo demonstrates how to use the [MaxFileSize](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload.MaxFileSize) and [AllowedFileExtensions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxUpload.AllowedFileExtensions) properties to limit the maximum file size and specify accepted file extensions.

You should also validate uploaded files on the server side (in controller actions). The code above creates the UploadValidationController that checks file extensions and file size.
