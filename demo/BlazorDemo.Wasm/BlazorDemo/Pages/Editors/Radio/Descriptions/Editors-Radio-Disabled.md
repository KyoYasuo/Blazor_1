Our [Radio](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRadio-1) component allows you to disable an individual radio button. When a radio button is disabled, it cannot be focused/selected. Set the [Enabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRadio-1.Enabled) property to `false` to activate this mode.

This demo illustrates how to disable options conditionally (based on installed languages).
