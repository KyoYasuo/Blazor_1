You can specify whether Menu arranges items vertically or horizontally (the [Orientation](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMenu.Orientation) property).

For each of these Orientation options, you can also choose between the following [DisplayMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMenu.DisplayMode) options:

*   **Auto** — adapts to the device.
*   **Desktop** — cascading menus. Root level items appear in a horizontal or vertical panel. In horizontal orientation, second-level menus drop down. In vertical orientation, second-level menus appear to the right or left side.
*   **Mobile** — a compact layout. In horizontal orientation, the component emulates a hamburger menu. In vertical orientation, root level items appear in the same way as in Desktop mode. The second-level menu appears within the same container (and includes a Back button).

In this demo, you can switch between display and orientation modes and review all available combinations.
