This demo illustrates use of our TreeView component's [Recursive](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.TreeViewCheckMode) check mode. When active, the component recursively checks a child nodeâ€™s check state and those of parent nodes (whether they are allowed to be checked: the [TreeViewNode.AllowCheck](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeViewNode.AllowCheck) property is `true`. The parent node's CheckBox is checked if all child nodes are checked. Otherwise, the CheckBox will remain in an indeterminate state.
